Information
-----------

CheMPS2 is a scientific library which contains a spin-adapted implementation 
of the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) for ab initio quantum 
chemistry. This method allows to obtain numerical accuracy in active spaces 
beyond the capabilities of full configuration interaction (FCI):

* up to 40 electrons in 40 orbitals for general active spaces
* up to 100 electrons in 100 orbitals for one-dimensional active spaces, such as the pi-system of all-trans polyenes

In addition, DMRG allows to obtain the 2-RDM of the active space efficiently. 
The method is therefore ideal to replace the FCI solver in the complete active 
space self consistent field (CASSCF) method, when the active space size becomes 
prohibitively expensive for FCI. The corresponding method is called DMRG-SCF. 
Because DMRG can handle the abovementioned active space sizes, it allows to
obtain FCI energies for small systems such as dimers, while for larger systems
it is ideal to treat the static/strong correlation in a large active space.

CheMPS2 is designed to be a high-performance library. For an input
Hamiltonian and targeted symmetry sector, the library performs successive
DMRG sweeps according to a user-defined convergence scheme. As output,
the library returns the minimal encountered energy as well as the 2-RDM,
3-RDM and various orbital correlation functions in the active space. With 
the 2-RDM, various molecular properties can be calculated, as well as the 
gradient and Hessian for orbital rotations or nuclear displacements.

CheMPS2 is parallelized for shared memory architectures with the Open
Multi-Processing ([OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)) API and for distributed 
memory architectures with the Message Passing Interface
([MPI](http://www.mpi-forum.org/)). A hybrid combination of both
parallelization strategies is supported.

To gain a better understanding of how to perform DMRG calculations for
large active spaces, you are encouraged to read the
[user manual](http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html) and the
[three papers](#how-to-acknowledge-chemps2) listed below.

Incorporation of the library into other codes is very simple due a
minimal API, as well as a python interface. Direct usage of the
library is illustrated in

* the [c++](#4-test-libchemps2) tests
* the [python](#7-test-pychemps2) tests
* the [binary](#5-test-the-chemps2-binary) example

The interfaces to [psi4](http://www.psicode.org)
and [pyscf](https://github.com/sunqm/pyscf) are described in the
[user manual](http://sebwouters.github.io/CheMPS2/index.html).

Installation
------------

### 1. Dependencies

CheMPS2 can be built with [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) and depends on

-   BLAS
-   LAPACK
-   GSL ([GNU Scientific library](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/))
-   HDF5 ([Hierarchical Data Format Release 5](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/))

It is parallelized for shared memory architectures with the Open
Multi-Processing ([OpenMP](http://openmp.org/wp/)) API and for
distributed memory architectures with the Message Passing Interface
([MPI](http://www.mpi-forum.org/)). A hybrid combination of both
parallelization strategies is supported.

### 2. Download

It is advised to clone the CheMPS2 git repository from github. In your
terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder
    > git clone 'https://github.com/sebwouters/chemps2'
    > cd chemps2

That way, future updates and bug fixes can be easily pulled in:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2
    > git pull

### 3. Build the chemps2 library and binary

The files

    /sourcefolder/chemps2/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/CheMPS2/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/tests/CMakeLists.txt
    /sourcefolder/chemps2/sphinx/CMakeLists.txt

provide a minimal compilation. In your terminal, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2
    > mkdir build
    > cd build

CMake generates makefiles based on the userâ€™s specifications:

    > CXX=option1 cmake .. -DMKL=option2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/option3 -DWITH_MPI=option4

1.  Option1 is the `c++` compiler; typically `g++`, `icpc`, or `clang++`
    on Linux. It is advised to use the intel compiler if available.
2.  Option2 can be `ON` or `OFF` and is used to switch on the intel math
    kernel library.
3.  /option3 is the prefix of the installation directory; typically `/usr`
    or `/usr/local` on Linux. On my computer, libchemps2 is then installed
    in `/option3/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, the headers in
    `/option3/include/chemps2`, and the binary in
    `/option3/bin/chemps2`.
4.  Option4 can be `ON` or `OFF` and is used to switch on the possibility
    to compile with MPI. Please note that the compiler should then provide
    `mpi.h`. Option1 should hence be the `mpic++` compiler; typically
    `mpic++` or `mpiicpc` on Linux. It is advised to use the intel compiler
    if available.

If one or more of the required libraries are not found, use the command

    > CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=option5 CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=option6 CXX=option1 cmake .. -DMKL=option2 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/option3 -DWITH_MPI=option4

instead, where option5 and option6 are respectively the missing
colon-separated include and library paths:

    CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=/my_libs/lib1/include:/my_libs/lib2/include
    CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=/my_libs/lib1/lib:/my_libs/lib2/lib
    
For debian/sid, the HDF5 headers are located in the folder
`/usr/include/hdf5/serial`. If CMake complains about the HDF5 headers,
try to pass it with the option
`-DHDF5_INCLUDE_DIRS=/usr/include/hdf5/serial`.

To compile, run:

    > make

To install, run:

    > make install

For non-standard installation directories, please remember to append the
library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in your `.bashrc`.

### 4. Test libchemps2

To test libchemps2 for compilation **without MPI**, run:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build
    > make test

To test libchemps2 for compilation **with MPI**, run:
    
    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build/tests
    > OMP_NUM_THREADS=YYY mpirun -np ZZZ ./test1
    > OMP_NUM_THREADS=YYY mpirun -np ZZZ ./test2
    ...
    > OMP_NUM_THREADS=YYY mpirun -np ZZZ ./test11
    > OMP_NUM_THREADS=YYY mpirun -np ZZZ ./test12

`YYY` specifies the number of threads per process and `ZZZ` the number of
processes. Note that the tests are too small to see (near) linear scaling
with the number of cores, although improvement should still be noticeable.

### 5. Test the chemps2 binary

To test the chemps2 binary for compilation **without MPI**, run:

    > man /sourcefolder/chemps2/chemps2.1
    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/build/CheMPS2
    > ./chemps2 --help
    > ./chemps2 --fcidump=/sourcefolder/chemps2/tests/matrixelements/H2O.631G.FCIDUMP \
                --group=5 \
                --sweep_d=200,1000 \
                --sweep_econv=1e-8,1e-8 \
                --sweep_maxit=2,10 \
                --sweep_noise=0.05,0.0 \
                --twodmfile=2dm.out \
                --print_corr \
                --reorder=6,5,4,3,2,1,0,7,8,9,10,11,12
    
To test the chemps2 binary for compilation **with MPI**, prepend the binary with:

    > OMP_NUM_THREADS=YYY mpirun -np ZZZ ./chemps2 [OPTIONS]

### 6. Build PyCheMPS2

PyCheMPS2 is a python interface to libchemps2, for
compilation **without MPI**. It can be built with
[Cython](http://cython.org/). The installation is independent of
CMake and assumes that you have installed the CheMPS2 library with
`make install`. For non-standard installation directories of CheMPS2,
please remember to append the library path to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` in
your `.bashrc`. In addition, the include path should be appended
to `CPATH`:

    > export CPATH=${CPATH}:/option3/include

where `/option3` is the option provided to CMake with
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/option3` above. For debian/sid, the HDF5
headers are located in the folder `/usr/include/hdf5/serial`. If it
was explicitly passed to CMake, it should also be appended to `CPATH`:

    > export CPATH=${CPATH}:/option3/include:/usr/include/hdf5/serial

The python wrapper can be installed with:

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/PyCheMPS2
    > python setup.py build_ext -L ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
    > python setup.py install --prefix=/option3

On my machine, the python wrapper is installed to the folder
`/option3/lib/python2.7/site-packages`, but the folder `lib` and
the distribution of python can vary.

Compilation of PyCheMPS2 occurs by linking to the `c++` library in the
installation directory. The installation of PyCheMPS2 will fail if that
library is not properly installed. If you have pulled a newer version of
CheMPS2, please remember to reinstall the `c++` library first, before
reinstalling PyCheMPS2!


### 7. Test PyCheMPS2

When libchemps2 has been compiled **without MPI**, PyCheMPS2 can be tested
by running (remember that the python site-packages folder can vary):

    > cd /sourcefolder/chemps2/PyCheMPS2/tests
    > export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/option3/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    > python test1.py
    > python test2.py
    ...
    > python test11.py
    > python test12.py

If you compiled the `c++` library with `-DMKL=ON`, you might get the error

    Intel MKL FATAL ERROR: Cannot load libmkl_avx.so or libmkl_def.so.

This issue of using Intelâ€™s MKL inside python is known and reported. To
get the python tests to run, you can set the variable `LD_PRELOAD` in
order to preload libmkl\_rt.so. On my system, this is done with

    > export LD_PRELOAD=/opt/intel/mkl/lib/intel64/libmkl_rt.so

The python tests do exactly the same thing as the `c++` tests above, and
illustrate the usage of the python interface to libchemps2. The tests
should end with a line stating whether or not they succeeded. Note that the
tests are too small to see (near) linear scaling with the number of cores,
although improvement should still be noticeable.
